        Otto Von Chesterfield, Esquire
    </h3>

    <p>
        Chester, for short. A cat who tries very hard to seem aloof but fails miserably.
        Often seen batting objects across the room. Particularly fond of hair ties and rubber bands.
        Frightened of plastic bags. Will run to greet you at the door. Will waddle at variable speeds
        to his name and variations including but not limited to: Cheddar, Cheddar bay biscuit, cat.
