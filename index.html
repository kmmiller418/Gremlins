            Otto Von Chesterfield, Esquire
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            Chester, for short. A cat who tries very hard to seem aloof but fails miserably.
            Often seen batting objects across the room. Prone to 4 am zoomies and occasional sideways running.
            Particularly fond of hair ties and rubber bands. Menace around plants, real or fake. 
            Frightened of plastic bags. Will run to greet you at the door. Will waddle at variable speeds to his name and variations 
            including but not limited to:
